# Blackboard
A simple drawing app that resembles an old school blackboard.

Includes the ability to change colors with 6 colors to choose from. The black color is used as the eraser. 
You can also resize the 'chalk'.
There is an option to save, but you are required to give it an extension and a name, if you choose one.
